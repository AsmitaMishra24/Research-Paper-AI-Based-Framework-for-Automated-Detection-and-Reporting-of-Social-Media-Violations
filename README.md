# 🔍 AI-Based Framework for Automated Detection and Reporting of Social Media Violations

## 📘 Abstract
This repository presents the research work titled **"AI-Based Framework for Automated Detection and Reporting of Social Media Violations"**, which proposes a scalable, ethical, and accurate AI-driven solution to automatically detect and moderate harmful content on social platforms. The framework leverages **multi-modal machine learning**—combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, and **Anomaly Detection**—to analyze and act upon content in real time, addressing critical challenges in **hate speech**, **misinformation**, **explicit material**, and **cyberbullying**.

We express sincere gratitude to Prof. Parag Sohoni for his invaluable mentorship, insights, and academic guidance throughout the research.

## 🚀 Key Features of the Framework

- ✅ **Multi-Modal Detection**  
  Simultaneous processing of **text**, **images**, and **videos** using advanced ML and deep learning techniques.

- ✅ **NLP Module**  
  Utilizes transformer-based models like **BERT** for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and harmful language classification.

- ✅ **Computer Vision Engine**  
  Detects explicit or violent content using **CNNs**, **YOLOv7**, and **OpenCV** for image and video frame analysis.

- ✅ **Anomaly Detection System**  
  Flags irregular user behavior and unusual content patterns with unsupervised ML techniques like **Isolation Forests**.

- ✅ **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Enhances transparency by visualizing key decision factors behind content classification.

- ✅ **Human Feedback Loop**  
  Moderators can review flagged content and provide feedback to improve future model accuracy.

- ✅ **Real-Time Processing**  
  Designed to operate with <100ms latency for live moderation.

| Recall     | 80%   |
| F1-Score   | 84%   |

**Infrastructure:**  
Horizontal scalability supported via **Docker** & **Kubernetes**. Ideal for integration into enterprise-scale platforms.

## 🧠 Research Objectives

- Understand the evolving landscape of **harmful online content**
- Identify gaps in existing **moderation systems**
- Develop a **hybrid AI-human framework** that ensures:
  - Ethical decision-making
  - Cultural sensitivity
  - Legal and privacy compliance

## 🌐 Ethical and Legal Compliance

The system prioritizes:
- ✳️ **Bias Mitigation**: Auditable pipelines and adversarial testing.
- ✳️ **Fairness and Transparency**: Ensures balanced moderation without infringing on freedom of expression.
- ✳️ **Cultural Relevance**: Adaptable models to reflect regional languages and social contexts.
- ✳️ **Privacy Preservation**: Compliant with data protection laws like GDPR.

## 🔭 Future Work

- Integrate **distributed computing** for enhanced throughput.
- Deploy **self-supervised learning** for better adaptation to unseen violations.
- Embed **multi-language and regional support** to broaden global applicability.
- Develop public **APIs and dashboards** for real-time use by platforms.
